<h3>Namepaths in JSDoc 3</h3>

<p>
When referring to a JavaScript variable that is elsewhere in your documentation, you must provide a unique identifier that maps to that variable. A namepath provides a way to do so and disambiguate between instance members, static members and inner variables.
</p>

{{#example}}Basic Syntax Examples of Namepaths in JSDoc 3
myFunction
MyConstructor
MyConstructor#instanceMember
MyConstructor.staticMember
MyConstructor~innerMember // note that JSDoc 2 uses a dash
{{/example}}

<p>
The example below shows: an <em>instance</em> method named "say," an <em>inner</em> function also named "say," and a <em>static</em> method also named "say." These are three distinct methods that all exist independently of one another.
</p>

{{#example}}Use a documentation tag to describe your code.
/** @constructor */
Person = function() {
    this.say = function() {
        return "I'm an instance.";
    }
    
    function say() {
        return "I'm inner.";
    }
}
Person.say = function() {
    return "I'm static.";
}

var p = new Person();
p.say();      // I'm an instance.
Person.say(); // I'm static.
// there is no way to directly access the inner function from here
{{/example}}

<p>
You would use three different namepath syntaxes to refer to the three different methods:
</p>

{{#example}}Use a documentation tag to describe your code.
Person#say  // the instance method named "say."
Person.say  // the static method named "say."
Person~say  // the inner method named "say."
{{/example}}

<p>
You might wonder why there is a syntax to refer to an inner method when that method isn't directly accessible from outside the function it is defined in. While that is true, and thus the "~" syntax is rarely used, it <em>is</em> possible to return a reference to an inner method from another method inside that container, so it is possible that some object elsewhere in your code might borrow an inner method.
</p>

<p>
Note that if a constructor has an instance member that is also a constructor, you can simply chain the namepaths together to form a longer namepath:
<p>

{{#example}}Use a documentation tag to describe your code.
/** @constructor */
Person = function() {
    /** @constructor */
    this.Idea = function() {
        this.consider = function(){
            return "hmmm";
        }
    }
}

var p = new Person();
var i = new p.Idea();
i.consider();
{{/example}}

<p>
In this case, to refer to the method named "consider," you would use the following namepath:
<code>Person#Idea#consider</code></p>

<p>
This chaining can be used with any combination of the connecting symbols: <code># . ~</code></p>

{{#example}}Special cases: modules, externals and events.
/** A module. Its name is module:foo/bar.
 * @module foo/bar
 */
/** The built in string object. Its name is external:String.
 * @external String
 */
/** An event. Its name is module:foo/bar.event:MyEvent.
 * @event module:foo/bar.event:MyEvent
 */
{{/example}}

<p>
There are some special cases with namepaths: <a href="tags-module.html">@modules</a> are prefixed by "module:", <a href="tags-external.html">@externals</a> are prefixed by "external:", and <a href="tags-event.html">@event</a> names are prefixed by "event:".
</p>

{{#example}}Namepaths of objects with special characters in the name.
/** @namespace */
var chat = {
    /** Refer to this by {@link chat."#channel"}.
     * @namespace */
    "#channel": {
        /** Refer to this by {@link chat."#channel".open}.
         * @type {boolean}
         * @defaultvalue */
        open: true,
        /** Internal quotes have to be escaped by backslash. This is
         * {@link chat."#channel"."say-\"hello\""}. */
        'say-"hello"': function (msg) {};
    }
};

/** Now we define an event in our {@link chat.#channel} namespace.
	@event chat."#channel"."op:announce-motd"
 */
{{/example}}
<p>
Above is an example of a namespace with "unusual" characters in its member names (the hash character, dashes, even quotes).
To refer to these you just need quote the names: chat."#channel", chat."#channel"."op:announce-motd", and so on.
Internal quotes in names should be escaped with backslashes: chat."#channel"."say-\"hello\"".
