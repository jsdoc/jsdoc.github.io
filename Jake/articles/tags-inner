<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Using the @inner tag will mark a symbol as an inner member of its parent symbol.
This means it can be referred to by "Parent~Child".
</p>

<p>
Using '@inner' will override a doclet's default scope (unless it is in the global scope, in which case it will remain global).
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

{{#example}}Using @inner to make a virtual doclet an inner member
/** @namespace MyNamespace */
/** myFunction is now MyNamespace~myFunction.
 * @function myFunction
 * @memberof MyNamespace
 * @inner
 */
{{/example}}
<p>
Note that in the above we could have used "@function MyNamespace~myFunction" instead of the @memberof and @inner tags.
</p>

{{#example}}Using @inner
/** @namespace */
var MyNamespace = {
    /** foo is now MyNamespace~foo rather than MyNamespace.foo.
     * @inner */
    foo: 1
};
{{/example}}

<p>
In the above example, we use @inner to force a member of a namespace to be documented as an inner member (by default, it would be a static member). This means that <code>foo</code> now has longname <code>MyNamespace~foo</code> instead of <code>MyNamespace.foo</code> that it would have been otherwise.
