<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>@mixin [&lt;MixinName&gt;]</code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
A mixin is a class providing functionality that is intended to be added in to other classes desiring that functionality.
The @mixin tag allows the user to mark an object as a mixin.
</p>

<p>
For example, you might have an "Eventful" mixin which provides event handling methods to other classes, but isn't intended to be used itself.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

{{#example}}Example of a @mixin
/**
 * This provides methods used for event handling. It's not meant to
 * be used directly, except as a provider of related methods.
 *
 * @mixin
 */
var Eventful = {
    /** Register a handler function to be called whenever this event is fired.
     * @param {string} eventName - name of the event
     * @param {Eventful~eventHandler} handler - the handler to be called.
     */
    on: function(eventName, handler) {
        // code...
    },
   
    /** Fires an event, causing all handlers for that event name to run.
     * @param {string} eventName - name of the event 
     * @param {object} eventData - passed into each handler.
     */
    fire: function(eventName, eventData) {
        // code...
    }
};
/** Used as an event callback {@link Eventful.on}.
 * @callback Eventful~eventHandler
 * @param {object} eventData - the event data.
 */
{{/example}}

<p>
In the above we document a set of methods, Eventful, that can be mixed in to other classes to give them the ability to fire and listen to events.
(Note also the use of the <a href="tags-callback.html">@callback</a> tag to document the event handler parameter in the "on" function - we could have just written "@param {function(object)} handler" instead if we didn't want to use that).
</p>

<p>
Use <a href="tags-mixes.html">@mixes</a> to indicate in the documentation that another class mixes in Eventful (you are still responsible for doing the actual mixing in the code, however). Note, this doesn't support references like "{@link FormButton#on}" (yet). 
</p>

{{#example}}Having another class @mixes Eventful
/**
 * @constructor FormButton
 * @mixes Eventful
 */
var FormButton = function() {
    // code...
};
FormButton.prototype.press = function() {
  this.fire('press', {});
}
mix(Eventful).into(FormButton.prototype);

function mix(source) {
  return {into: function(target) {
    for (var property in source) {
      if( !(property in {}) ) {
        target[property] = source[property]
      }
    }
    return this;
  }};
}
