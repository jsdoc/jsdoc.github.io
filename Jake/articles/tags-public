<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The @public tag indicates that a variable should be documented as if it were public.
</p>
<p>
This tag doesn't really do anything - all doclets are public by default anyway, so leaving the tag out is the same as putting it in.
All @public does is negate a @protected or @private. 
It <em>doesn't</em> affect scopes; <a href="tags-instance.html">@instance</a>, <a href="tags-instance.html">@instance</a>, <a href="tags-static.html">@static</a> and <a href="tags-global.html">@global</a> do that.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

{{#example}}
/** @class */
function Thingy() {
    /** The @public doesn't really do anything - this is still Thingy~foo.
     * @public */
    var foo = 0;
}
{{/example}}
