<p>
    <code>@augments &lt;namepath&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3>
    Overview
</h3>

<p>
    The @augments or @extends tag marks a symbol as augmenting another symbol.
</p>

<p>
    While current versions of JavaScript don't allow classes or subclasses in the same way that class-based languages like Java do, many programmers choose to think of their code structure in these terms. For this purpose JSDoc provides the @class and @extends tags. If you wish to express a similar relationship between two symbols, but don't wish to promote the classical analogy, you can use the @contructor and @augments tags instead.
</p>

<h3>
    Examples
</h3>

<p>
    In the example below I wish to document the fact that Ducks are a specialised form of Animal: meaning that Duck instances are like Animal instances which have been augmented with additional properties.

<p>
    A related pattern can be documented with the @mixin and @mixes tags. Or, if the augmented symbol is only reusing one or two members of another symbol, you may find the @borrows tag more convenient.
