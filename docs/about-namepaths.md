## Namepaths in JSDoc 3

When referring to a JavaScript variable that is elsewhere in your documentation, you must provide a unique identifier that maps to that variable. A namepath provides a way to do so and disambiguate between instance members, static members and inner variables.

-   **Basic Syntax Examples of Namepaths in JSDoc 3**

```
myFunction
MyConstructor
MyConstructor#instanceMember
MyConstructor.staticMember
MyConstructor~innerMember // note that JSDoc 2 uses a dash
```

The example below shows: an _instance_ method named "say," an _inner_ function also named "say," and a _static_ method also named "say." These are three distinct methods that all exist independently of one another.

-   **Use a documentation tag to describe your code.**

```js
/** @constructor */
Person = function () {
    this.say = function () {
        return "I'm an instance.";
    };

    function say() {
        return "I'm inner.";
    }
};
Person.say = function () {
    return "I'm static.";
};

var p = new Person();
p.say(); // I'm an instance.
Person.say(); // I'm static.
// there is no way to directly access the inner function from here
```

You would use three different namepath syntaxes to refer to the three different methods:

-   **Use a documentation tag to describe your code.**

```
Person#say  // the instance method named "say."
Person.say  // the static method named "say."
Person~say  // the inner method named "say."
```

You might wonder why there is a syntax to refer to an inner method when that method isn't directly accessible from outside the function it is defined in. While that is true, and thus the "~" syntax is rarely used, it _is_ possible to return a reference to an inner method from another method inside that container, so it is possible that some object elsewhere in your code might borrow an inner method.

Note that if a constructor has an instance member that is also a constructor, you can simply chain the namepaths together to form a longer namepath:

-   **Use a documentation tag to describe your code.**

```js
/** @constructor */
Person = function () {
    /** @constructor */
    this.Idea = function () {
        this.consider = function () {
            return 'hmmm';
        };
    };
};

var p = new Person();
var i = new p.Idea();
i.consider();
```

In this case, to refer to the method named "consider," you would use the following namepath:
`Person#Idea#consider`

This chaining can be used with any combination of the connecting symbols: `# . ~`

-   **Special cases: modules, externals and events.**

```js
/** A module. Its name is module:foo/bar.
 * @module foo/bar
 */
/** The built in string object. Its name is external:String.
 * @external String
 */
/** An event. Its name is module:foo/bar.event:MyEvent.
 * @event module:foo/bar.event:MyEvent
 */
```

There are some special cases with namepaths: [@module][module-tag] names are prefixed by "module:", [@external][external-tag] names are prefixed by "external:", and [@event][event-tag] names are prefixed by "event:".

-   **Namepaths of objects with special characters in the name.**

```js
/** @namespace */
var chat = {
    /**
     * Refer to this by {@link chat."#channel"}.
     * @namespace
     */
    '#channel': {
        /**
         * Refer to this by {@link chat."#channel".open}.
         * @type {boolean}
         * @defaultvalue
         */
        open: true,
        /**
         * Internal quotes have to be escaped by backslash. This is
         * {@link chat."#channel"."say-\"hello\""}.
         */
        'say-"hello"': function (msg) {},
    },
};

/**
 * Now we define an event in our {@link chat."#channel"} namespace.
 * @event chat."#channel"."op:announce-motd"
 */
```

Above is an example of a namespace with "unusual" characters in its member names (the hash character, dashes, even quotes).
To refer to these you just need quote the names: chat."#channel", chat."#channel"."op:announce-motd", and so on.
Internal quotes in names should be escaped with backslashes: chat."#channel"."say-\"hello\"".
