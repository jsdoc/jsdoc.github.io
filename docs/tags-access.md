## Syntax

`@access <package|private|protected|public>`


## Overview

The `@access` tag specifies the access level of a member. You can use the `@access` tag as a
synonym for other tags:

+ `@access package` is the same as `@package`. This option is available in JSDoc 3.5.0 and later.
+ `@access private` is the same as `@private`.
+ `@access protected` is the same as `@protected`.
+ `@access public` is the same as `@public`.

Private members are not shown in the generated output unless JSDoc is run with the `-p/--private`
command-line option. In JSDoc 3.3.0 and later, you can also use the [`-a/--access` command-line
option][access-option] to change this behavior.

Note that a doclet's _access level_ is different from its _scope_. For example, if `Parent` has an
inner variable named `child` that is documented as `@public`, the `child` variable will still be
treated as an inner variable with the namepath `Parent~child`. In other words, the `child` variable
will have an inner scope, even though the variable is public. To change a doclet's scope, use the
[`@instance`][instance-tag], [`@static`][static-tag], and [`@global`][global-tag] tags.

## Examples

- **Using @access as a synonym for other tags**

```js
/** @constructor */
function Thingy() {

    /** @access private */
    var foo = 0;

    /** @access protected */
    this._bar = 1;

    /** @access package */
    this.baz = 2;

    /** @access public */
    this.pez = 3;

}

// same as...

/** @constructor */
function OtherThingy() {

    /** @private */
    var foo = 0;

    /** @protected */
    this._bar = 1;

    /** @package */
    this.baz = 2;

    /** @public */
    this.pez = 3;

}
```
