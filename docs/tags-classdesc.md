## Syntax

`@classdesc <some description>`


## Overview

The @classdesc tag is used to provide a description for a class, separate from the constructor
function's description. Use the @classdesc tag in combination with the [@class (or @constructor)
tag][class-tag].

The functionality of the @classdesc tag in JSDoc 3 duplicates that of the @class in previous
versions. As of version 3, the syntax and functionality of the @class tag now exactly matches the
@constructor tag, and the @classdesc tag more explicitly communicates its purpose: to document a
class's description.

[class-tag]: tags-class


## Examples

As shown below, a class has places for two descriptions, one applies to the function itself, while
the other applies to the class in general.

- **A doclet with both a constructor function description and a class description**

```js
/**
 * This is a description of the MyClass constructor function.
 * @class
 * @classdesc This is a description of the MyClass class.
 */
function MyClass() {
}
```
