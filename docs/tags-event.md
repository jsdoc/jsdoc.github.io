## Syntax

`@event <className>#[event:]<eventName>`


## Overview

The @event tag allows you to document an event that can be fired. A typical event is represented by
an object with a defined set of properties.

Once you have used the @event tag to define a specific type of event, you can use the @fires tag to
indicate that a method can fire that event. You can also use the @listens tag to indicate that a
symbol listens for the event.

JSDoc automatically prepends the namespace `event:` to each event's name. In general, you must
include this namespace when you link to the event in another doclet. (The @fires tag is a notable
exception; it allows you to omit the namespace.)

**Note**: JSDoc 3 uses @event doclets to document the content of an event. In contrast, JSDoc
Toolkit 2 used @event doclets to identify a function that can be fired when an event of the same
name occurs.


## Examples

The following examples show how to document an event in the `Hurl` class called `snowball`. The
event contains an object with a single property.

- **Documenting a function call as an event**

```js
/**
 * Throw a snowball.
 *
 * @fires Hurl#snowball
 */
Hurl.prototype.snowball = function() {
    /**
     * Snowball event.
     *
     * @event Hurl#snowball
     * @type {object}
     * @property {boolean} isPacked - Indicates whether the snowball is tightly packed.
     */
    this.emit('snowball', {
        isPacked: this._snowball.isPacked
    });
};
```


- **Using a named doclet to document an event**

```js
/**
 * Throw a snowball.
 *
 * @fires Hurl#snowball
 */
Hurl.prototype.snowball = function() {
    // ...
};

/**
 * Snowball event.
 *
 * @event Hurl#snowball
 * @type {object}
 * @property {boolean} isPacked - Indicates whether the snowball is tightly packed.
 */
```
