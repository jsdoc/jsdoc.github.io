## Syntax

`@license <identifier>`


## Overview

The `@license` tag identifies the software license that applies to any portion of your code.

You can use any text to identify the license you are using. If your code uses a standard open-source
license, consider using the appropriate identifier from the [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)
License List][spdx].

Some JavaScript processing tools, such as Google's Closure Compiler, will automatically preserve
any JSDoc comment that includes a `@license` tag. If you are using one of these tools, you may wish
to add a standalone JSDoc comment that includes the `@license` tag, along with the entire text of
the license, so that the license text will be included in generated JavaScript files.
