## Syntax

With the JSDoc tag dictionary (enabled by default):

`@private`

With the [Closure Compiler][closure] tag dictionary:

`@private [{typeExpression}]`

[closure]: https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler#jsdoc-tags


## Overview

The `@private` tag marks a symbol as private, or not meant for general use. Private members are not
shown in the generated output unless JSDoc is run with the `-p/--private` command-line option. In
JSDoc 3.3.0 and later, you can also use the [`-a/--access` command-line option][access-option] to
change this behavior.

The `@private` tag is not inherited by child members. For example, if the `@private` tag is added to
a namespace, members of the namespace can still appear in the generated output; because the
namespace is private, the members' namepath will not include the namespace.

The `@private` tag is equivalent to `@access private`.

[access-option]: about-commandline


## Examples

In the following example, `Documents` and `Documents.Newspaper` appear in the generated
documentation, but not `Documents.Diary`.

- **Using the @private tag**

```js
/** @namespace */
var Documents = {
    /**
     * An ordinary newspaper.
     */
    Newspaper: 1,
    /**
     * My diary.
     * @private
     */
    Diary: 2
};
```
