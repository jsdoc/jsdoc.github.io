## Overview

The @static tag indicates that a symbol is contained within a parent and can be accessed without
instantiating the parent.

Using the @static tag will override a symbol's default scope, with one exception: Symbols in global
scope will remain global.


## Examples

The following example has the same effect as writing "@function MyNamespace.myFunction" and omitting
the @memberof and @static tags:

- **Using @static in a virtual comment**

```js
/** @namespace MyNamespace */

/**
 * @function myFunction
 * @memberof MyNamespace
 * @static
 */
```


The following example forces a module's inner member to be documented as a static member:

- **Using @static to override the default scope**

```js
/** @module Rollerskate */

/**
 * The 'wheel' variable is documented as Rollerskate.wheel
 * rather than Rollerskate~wheel.
 * @static
 */
var wheel = 1;
```
